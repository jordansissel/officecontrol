# Office Automation

Sometimes you just need to build a few weird gadgets.

## Office?

I work at home, and I hobby code from time to time.

Audio for the office goes through a Denon AVR-720w. This device has support for network controls.
I have this switch inputs depending on what machine (personal or work) I am logged into, and also power it off when I lock my screen.

Taped to the bottom of my monitor is a strip of [SK6812](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/1138/SK6812+LED+datasheet+.pdf) which provides task lighting and some fun color accents.
